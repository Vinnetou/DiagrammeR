There is very good \r\ndocumentation available for the package (at the above link), but learning by \r\ndoing is often best and that's where swirl thrives!  \r\n\r\nThis course will guide you through some of the basics of DiagrammeR and give you \r\nsome hands on experience with the package. Hopefully this will serve as a great \r\nspringboard for you so that you can produce all kinds of wonderful diagrams in \r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nAt the moment this course is still very much a work in progress but please \r\nfeel free to give it a try in it's current state and report any problems you \r\nhave or leave suggestions for improvement on the \r\n[issues page](https://github.com/jonmcalder/DiagrammeR/issues) as you work \r\nthrough the lessons.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to submit a pull request that would be even better! :-)\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to the swirl developers \r\n@[ncarchedi](https://github.com/ncarchedi), \r\n@[seankross](https://github.com/seankross), and \r\n@[WilCrofter](https://github.com/WilCrofter) as well as many others who have \r\ncontributed code and/or learning content to swirl. \r\n\r\nI would like to commend them for the excellent documentation for swirl and \r\nswirlify as these are essential for anyone looking to get started. \r\n\r\nAnd of course big thanks to @[rich-iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone), \r\nthe creator of the DiagrammeR package, who also sets a really high standard with \r\nthe awesome documentation for DiagrammeR.",
