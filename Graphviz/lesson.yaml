  Output: This lesson will focus on the GraphViz DOT language. As highlighted in
    the introductory lesson, DiagrammeR provides the grViz() function for 
    creating GraphViz graphs, to which a graph specification is provided as a 
    string argument (or via a file connection). 
    
- Class: text
  Output: The basic structure for the string provided to grViz() is 
    "<1>[strict] <2>(graph | digraph) <3>[ID] { <4>stmt_list }". These 4 
    elements will be described below.
    
- Class: text
  Output: <1> Adding the optional "strict" declaration at the beginning of the 
    graph specification prevents duplicate edges between any pair of nodes.
    
- Class: text
  Output: <2> The graph can be either directed ("digraph") or undirected 
    ("graph").

- Class: text
  Output: <3> The ID is an optional string name for the graph

- Class: text
  Output: <4> The statement list contains the 'meat' of the graph specification, 
    detailing the nodes, edges, and the various attributes of each of these.
