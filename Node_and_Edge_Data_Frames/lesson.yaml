  Output: In the previous lessons we looked at how to create diagrams using 
    graphViz() and mermaid() which support the original syntax and framework for 
    specifying diagrams for each of these respective libraries. We will now look 
    at the building blocks for a completely different approach, which utilizes R 
    functions to create diagrams iteratively.

  Output: This lesson will be brief but important, as we outline the workings of 
    four key functions - create_nodes(), create_edges(), combine_nodes() and 
    combine_edges(). These functions are used to create and manipulate specialized 
    data frames - node data frames (NDFs) and edge data frames (EDFs) - which can 
    then in turn be used to create graph diagrams.
