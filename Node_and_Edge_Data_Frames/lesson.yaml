  Output: In the previous lessons we looked at how to create diagrams using 
    graphViz() and mermaid() which support the original syntax and framework for 
    specifying diagrams for each of these respective libraries. We will now look 
    at the building blocks for a completely different approach, which utilizes R 
    functions to create diagrams iteratively.

  Output: This lesson will be brief but important, as we outline the workings of 
    four key functions - create_node_df(), create_edge_df(), combine_ndfs() and 
    combine_edfs(). These functions are used to create and manipulate specialized 
    data frames - node data frames (NDFs) and edge data frames (EDFs) - which can 
    then in turn be used to create graph diagrams.

  Output: The create_node_df function is used to create a node data frame (NDF), 
    which is really just an R data.frame object. It contains a row for each node 
    and optional note attributes and/or additional data spread across the 
    columns. The only required argument is "n", the number of nodes to be 
    created in the NDF.

  Output: Create an NDF with 5 nodes.
  CorrectAnswer: create_node_df(10)

  Hint: create_node_df(10)

  Output: As you can see, when creating a node data frame, the first column in 
    the NDF contains the (unique) node IDs, followed by a type column and then a 
    label column, which will both be NULL if not provided in the call to 
    create_node_df().
