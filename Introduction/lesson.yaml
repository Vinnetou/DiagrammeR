    lesson by simply hitting escape. Alternatively type info() in the R console

  Output: It is highly recommended that you use RStudio for this course - since 
    RStudio provides a number of useful features and support for the DiagrammeR 
    package e.g. preview, export etc.

  Output: We also suggest that you maximise your R console window so that you 
    can read all the lesson and console output with a minimum amount of 
    scrolling back and forth. If you are using RStudio, it's probably best to 
    keep the script editing pane small or minimized if/when you are not using 
    it.

  Output: The DiagrammeR package supports two key types of graph description 
    languages - Graphviz and mermaid. One could say each outshines the other in 
    some respects, but there are definitely similarities and a fair amount of 
    overlap between them. We will provide a quick overview and some examples of 
    each in this introduction.
