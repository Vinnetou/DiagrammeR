  Output: In this lesson we will look at creating diagrams using mermaid. In a 
    similar fashion to GraphViz, DiagrammeR provides the mermaid() function 
    which takes a string argument (or file/text connection) specifying the 
    details of the diagram.

- Class: text
  Output: mermaid supports a range of different diagram types, each of which are
    specified in slightly different ways. We will first look at graphs and sub 
    graphs (flowcharts), before moving on to sequence diagrams, and then finally 
    Gant charts.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The mermaid graph specification begins with a declaration of "graph" 
    followed by the graph direction (which will determine the layout of the 
    nodes within the graph). The direction can be left to right ("LR"),
    right to left ("RL"), top to bottom/top down ("TB"/"TD"), or bottom to top 
    ("BT").

  Output: This can then be followed by a declaration of nodes and/or nodes and 
    edges. Nodes can be given arbitrary ID values and those IDs are displayed as 
    text within their respective boxes. Connections between nodes are denoted 
    by "-->" for arrow connections and "---" for line connections.
      
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, the command mermaid("graph LR;A-->B;A-->C;B-->D;C-->D"), 
    will generate a graph with a series of nodes (A, B, C, D) arranged in a 
    left-to-right layout, with the nodes connected with arrows. Give this a try 
    now by copying or re-typing the above command and explore the resulting 
    graph diagram to see how the node and edge commands are translated.
  CorrectAnswer: mermaid("graph LR;A-->B;A-->C;B-->D;C-->D")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = mermaid(ABCD))
  Hint: Copy the mermaid() command above to produce the graph.

  Output: Usually statements in a mermaid diagram specfication will each be 
    included on a separate line, but for simple diagrams (e.g. as above), this 
    can be done in a more succinct manner by including multiple statements on 
    a single line and separating them with semicolons.
