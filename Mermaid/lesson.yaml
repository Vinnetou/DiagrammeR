  Output: In this lesson we will look at creating diagrams using mermaid. In a 
    similar fashion to GraphViz, DiagrammeR provides the mermaid() function 
    which takes a string argument (or file/text connection) specifying the 
    details of the diagram.

  Output: mermaid supports a range of different diagram types, each of which are
    specified in slightly different ways. We will first look at graphs and sub 
    graphs (flowcharts), before moving on to sequence diagrams, and then finally 
    Gant charts.

  Output: The mermaid graph specification begins with a declaration of "graph" 
    followed by the graph direction (which will determine the layout of the 
    nodes within the graph). The direction can be left to right ("LR"),
    right to left ("RL"), top to bottom/top down ("TB"/"TD"), or bottom to top 
    ("BT").

  Output: This can then be followed by a declaration of nodes and/or nodes and 
    edges. Nodes can be given arbitrary ID values and those IDs are displayed as 
    text within their respective boxes. Connections between nodes are denoted 
    by "-->" for arrow connections and "---" for line connections.

  Output: For example, the command mermaid("graph LR;A-->B;A-->C;B-->D;C-->D"), 
    will generate a graph with a series of nodes (A, B, C, D) arranged in a 
    left-to-right layout, with the nodes connected with arrows.
